# ACE Grader

Automatic Code Evaluator and Grader

ACE Grader was developed as part of my Master's Dissertation in Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho. I was supervised by Professor Pedro Rangel Henriques and Professor Alda Gancarski.

## What is ACE Grader?
ACE Grader, as the name implies, is an automatic grading solution for programming exercises! It uses a combination of dynamic and static analysis in order to evaluate submitted programs.

## What is static analysis?
Unlike dynamic analysis, which only looks at a program's output, static analysis looks at the program itself. For example, ACE Grader can check if a function is recursive, unlike most automatic grading software. This can be extremely useful for grading introductory programming exercises, where students must use a specific concept in order to solve a problem.
